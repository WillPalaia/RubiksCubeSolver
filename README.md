# Rubik's Cube Solver
This project aims to provide a digital Rubik's Cube solver utilizing reinforcement learning techniques, specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The solver generates a virtual Rubik's Cube, scrambles it, and employs PPO with Manhattan distance heuristic to find an optimal solution.

After downloading required packages, run `main.py`
